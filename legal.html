            		<article>
            			<p>30-Day Free Trial: this version of our Service requires no credit card for signup. This gives you a zero-risk way to try our Service for 30 days. If you decide to upgrade at any time during the 30-Day Free Trial, the free trial ends and your Account is upgraded to a Paid Account.
						<br>
						Paid Account: When you purchase a Paid Account or upgrade from a 30-Day Free Trial to a Paid Account, the Invinsys billing system charges your credit card for the initial billing period. After that, the billing system automatically renews your Account every 30 days, and charges the appropriate amount to your credit card.
						<br>
						Cancellation/Termination: if you cancel your Account or if we terminate the Service for cause as specified in Section 10 of these Terms of Service, no further amounts will be charged to your credit card. However, you are responsible for any amounts already charged to your credit card.
						<br>
						Refunds: our Service is a pay-as-you-go service. Therefore, we do not issue refunds, even if you cancel your Account immediately after your credit card is charged for the new billing period. For example, if we charge your credit card on August 10th, and you cancel your Account on August 15th, you are still responsible for paying for the entire month. No subsequent charges are applied to your credit card, but the amounts already charged are not refunded.
